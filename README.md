## Introduction
This is a simple Neovim configuration for taking maths notes in LaTeX.

## Install
First install pynvim to your global python site packages:

```
Git clone this repo and cd into it:
```
git clone https://github.com/isaacjeffersonlee/nvim-for-latex

Symlink the nvim config to your .config directory:

You should see all the plugins being installed.
Once everything is installed, exit nvim by typing ZZ. 
Everything should now be installed.

## Learning Vim
Vim has a steep initial learning curve, but once you learn it, you'll never
want to use another text editor again.
A good place to start is `vimtutor`, in the terminal (once you have installed nvim),
type:
```
vimtutor
```
and you will be presented with an interactive vim tutorial that takes you
through the basics.
```
```
